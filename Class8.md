- JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:
- Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	x <<= f()	x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	x >>= f()	x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= f()	x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= f()	x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= f()	x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= f()	x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	x &&= f()	x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	x ||= f()	x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	x ?? (x = f())
- If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression. For example:

- For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

- In general, assignments are used within a variable declaration (i.e., with const, let, or var) or as standalone statements).

- You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

- The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
