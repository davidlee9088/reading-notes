Growth Mindset is my own vision regardless upon my ablilties. I can grow and improve upon with determination, excercise, and patient. Reminding myself to stay growth mindset.
Here is my own reminder everyday for growth mindset

1. It is okay to be terrible at start, just long as willing to learn
2. Can't help others unless I can help myself first
4. No excuses, just long as I am improving little bit everyday. No need to feel sad
