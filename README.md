**This is where I am going to write my reading assignments**. 

Growth Mindset is my own vision regardless upon my ablilties. I can grow and improve upon with determination, excercise, and patient. 

reminding myself to stay growth mindset
1. It is okay to be terrible at start, just long as willing to learn
2. Can't help others unless I can help myself first
3. My own jounrey
4. No excuses, just long as I am improving little bit little.
