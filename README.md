# My Reading Notes

**This is where I am going to write my reading assignments**. 

My name is Hanbyeol Lee. Former US Army Vet, and trying to become SD as we know the demand of the use of software development skills. 

Growth Mindset is my own vision regardless upon my ablilties. I can grow and improve upon with determination, excercise, and patient. Reminding myself to stay growth mindset.
Here is my own definition

1. It is okay to be terrible at start, just long as willing to learn
2. Can't help others unless I can help myself first
3. My own jounrey
4. No excuses, just long as I am improving little bit little.
